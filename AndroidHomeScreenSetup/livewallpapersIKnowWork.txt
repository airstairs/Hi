	DELETE UP TO DOWN APP STORE AFTER INSTALLING RAIN DROP APK

	you have to install up todown enable unknown sources and then relaunch the up to down app store and search for rain drop use the one that has the same icon as the link above,  once rain drop is installed you cannot set a custom background until you click customize and scroll down to select the CUSTOM PHOTO checkbox, once selected under it you can click load custom photo

	again open apk info from play store search live wallpaper more info enable then set the wallpaper using the rain drop app, once done delete apk info and delete up to down app store!


p.s. I dont know how to get custom wallpaper on nexus revamped as we cannot install the pro version from google play, I just use color backgrounds <3


also hey nintendo switches are safe to use, other consoles undetermined (here)


also pizza boy unsafe, sacrificed to save myBoy!, get a nintendo wired controller from walmart not onn, for 15 dollars and usb to usb c adapter and remap controlls to buttons in input key mappings and the controller will work with super mario world 2 advanced, can download from Roms Games
https://www.romsgames.net
Super Mario Advance 2: Super Mario World ROM | GBA Game

for on screen controlls it helps to enable a volume button as b and enlarge the a+b button to be bigger play with position on screen to get a working everytime, it helps to enable hit middle for a + b combo in my boy settings and when you hit a dont tap it swipe to it from b, it will work everytime that way <3 


P.S. There are now switch 2 wired controllers for the same price that are usb c to usb c that include adapter

WARNING AVOID THEY ARE FAKES and are filled with malicious intent </3
